abstract = {Arabica coffee is a significant economic driver in Northern Thailand and has substantial opportunities for market growth. However, the Thai coffee business must ensure consistent quality standards and is currently heavily dependent on manual labor, to first identify, and then remove substandard unroasted coffee beans. This research developed a classification model based on a Convolutional Neural Network to detect 17 types of defects in green coffee beans. The image augmentation phase was enhanced by rotating images at 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, and 270Â° and expanding the dataset from 979 original images across 17 defect types to a robust 6,853 images. Several architectures including MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2, InceptionV2, and ResNetV2 were assessed. Following extensive evaluations, MobileNetV3 emerged as the best-performing model and underwent further fine-tuning, achieving significant accuracy improvements through hyperparameter optimization. The model's robustness and generalizability were validated via 5-fold cross-validation, with accuracy ranging from 98.78 % to 99.84 % across all defect types. When tested with unseen data, the model achieved an accuracy of 88.63 %. A web application prototype was also developed for real-time coffee bean defect classification and its usability was tested. Seven farmers reported high satisfaction with the ease of use and effectiveness of the application in classifying coffee bean defects, with 71.4 % expressing a strong likelihood of recommending the application to others. These promising results demonstrate the practical utility of the model in enhancing quality sorting processes in the coffee industry.}

abstract = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an important way to solve the problems of image classification and recognition. It can realize effective feature representation and make continuous breakthroughs in the field of image recognition, but it needs a lot of time in the training process. At the same time, random forest (RF) has the advantages of fast training speed and high classification accuracy. Aiming at the problem of image classification and recognition, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on CNN, which inputs the features extracted by CNN into RF for classification. Since the random weight network can also obtain valid results, the gradient algorithm is not used to adjust the network parameters to avoid consuming a lot of time. Finally, experiments are conducted on MNIST dataset and rotated MNIST dataset, and the results show that the classification accuracy of the hybrid model has improved more than RF, and also, the generalization ability has been improved.},
